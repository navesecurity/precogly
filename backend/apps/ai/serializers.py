"""Serializer for per-tenant AI provider configuration.

The one subtlety here is the API key. It is *write-only*: the client may send a
new value, but the stored key is never serialized back — a database read should
not be a way to recover a customer's provider credential. So instead of exposing
the ciphertext (or, worse, the plaintext), the serializer offers two things:

* a write-only ``api_key`` field that, when non-blank, replaces the stored key;
* a read-only ``has_api_key`` flag so the UI can show "a key is set" and offer a
  "replace" affordance without ever seeing the secret.

This mirrors the admin form's posture (:mod:`apps.ai.admin`) and is the same
contract the settings UI consumes.
